A good starting point would be An Anarchist FAQ, \"[J.7.6 How could an anarchist revolution defend itself?](http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secJ7.html#secj76)\"\n\n&gt;As can be seen, anarchist theory has always addressed the necessity of defending a social revolution and proposed a solution -- the voluntary, self-managed militia organised by the free communes and federations of workers' associations. The militias would be unified and co-ordinated by federations of communes while delegates from each militia unit would co-ordinate the actual fighting. In times of peace the militia members would be living and working among the rest of the populace, and, thus, they would tend to have the same outlook and interests as their fellows. Moreover, in the case of foreign intervention, the importance of international solidarity is important (\"a social revolution cannot be a revolution in one nation alone. It is by nature an international revolution.\" \\[Bakunin, Op. Cit., p. 49\\]). Thus any foreign intervention would face the problems of solidarity actions and revolts on its own doorstep and not dare send its troops abroad for long, if at all. Ultimately, the only way to support a revolution is to make your own.\n\nAlso worth checking out is AFAQ's \"[Section I - What would an anarchist society look like?](http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secIcon.html)\"\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about anarchist perspectives on Mao and the Chinese Revolution, I'd recommend [this presentation](http://blackrosefed.org/audio-critical-introduction-chinese-revolution/) by Elliot Liu, and this classic [Ron Tabor essay](http://blackrosefed.org/in-defense-of-anarchism-chris-day-response/) that covers the rest of your questions as well, using China and Spain as examples.",

The \"disinformation material\" was even worse than today I think, mostly horror stories about immigrants. But I noticed over time that not only the posters didn't care, but any users didn't as well. And I think the main reason was they preferred the narrative to reality. Whats worse, the right-wingers kind of \"infected\" other centrist conservative users over time. So some people who were conservative but rational would basically surrender to the bullshit.

My father was a listener to right wing radio and I kind of latched on to Larry Elder.\n\nOver the years lean more rightward.\n\nThen 2008.  The financial crash happened and prop 8 was on the ballot in CA.  Prop 8 made me realize that right wing influence had eroded the values I had as a libertarian.  The financial crash made me realize that the conservatives are not committed to competitive marketplaces, their economic policy only serves the rich and powerful.  I had great sympathy for Occupy.\n\nSo I became a liberal Obama voter but I largely disengaged politically.  I wasn't a die-hard for Obama though.  I could see that he was still committed American empire in the ME.  Later on I started listening to NPR for news.  \n\nBut recently my interest in videoessays brought me to BreadTube.  Bob Chipman led me to Lindsay Ellis, Ellis led me to Contrapoints which led me to Shaun, Hbomb and PhilosophyTube.  \"Where do I find more?\", I googled.  Now I'm here.  I guess I'm still kind of liberal but I'm exposing myself to a ton of interesting and compelling arguments from BreadTube creators.  So I'm still learning, still conflicted as to were I 'ought' to be.  Like, should we fix capitalism or destroy it is a question I'm not prepared to give an answer to yet.",

Overall, i emphatically agree that it\\u2019s sad more people chose not to engage with these sorts of ideas/conversations, and Chomsky is a national treasure. (I also should say, originally I set out to reply to the whole video, but after typing what\\u2019s below on just the first three minutes, I decided to leave it there..)\n\nTo me this feels like a game of whisper down the lane, where an economist says one thing, Chomsky repeats it mostly right with a few changes, you repeat it again mostly right but by this point we\\u2019re getting pretty far from the original concept, and misunderstanding the original meaning. \n\nWhen economists favor growth of the pie, one of their base assumptions is a concept called Pareto efficiency[Pareto Efficency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency) . It\\u2019s a theoretical benchmark for evaluating economic outcomes. The main idea is that an outcome (such as, the state of the economy) is Pareto efficient when the only way to make someone better off, would be to take from someone else.  Growth is always good, because theoretically if you somehow (taxes) took from the \\u201cwinners\\u201d and compensated the \\u201closers\\u201d you could make everyone at least as well off as they were to start. \n\nIts one of the older ideas in economics, and in theory this is well and good, but in practice it breaks down predictably: politicians cite economic theory on the first part, and conveniently forget the second. Broadly economists have always known that growth without corrective reallocation is often a bad idea. \n\nI do take issue with the unsubstantiated implication Chomsky makes that \\u201cthe economists theorems might be good on paper but that\\u2019s not the world we live in.\\u201d This is a classic, anti-intellectual, hand-wringing argument - that he follows up with a rather unorthodox and unsubstantiated claim.\n\nChomsky is not an economic historian. Those people do exist, and would be well qualified to speak to his claims that state intervention is a stronger predictor of outcome than any number of other factors, but he is not one of them, and is out of line in the way he presents his criticism here. I don\\u2019t know the economic history of India, but I\\u2019m very unsettled by how quickly he dismisses a colleague with a presumably more relevant background to speak on the subject.",

I think driving on the shoulder to pass on a 2lane would be safer than  doing all that",

I picture someone that enjoys boobs, has female \"friends\" that offer hugs or he asks and he enjoys feeling their boobs press against him.  He's having hugs that I'm taking at face value sexualized because he enjoys the boobs. IF he takes it further than that I agree it is weird and not appropriate, but if he likes hugs and does it for the purpose of feeling their boobs but doesn't make them feel uncomfortable about it as in if they say no he respects it I'm not going to condemn the guy for a normal behavior. \n\nYou won't answer my question because you know there is an aspect I haven't told you about, it's the same idea.  I'm simply stating if you weren't there to see exactly how he is going about these hugs and his actions during the hugs don't condemn the guy.  You don't have all the info.  What if the girls are coming to him and giving him a hug as a way to say hello?",
