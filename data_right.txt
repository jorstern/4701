But this exposes another dumbass idea Ben keeps pushing, how all the minority candidates are losing despite his claims that intersectionality identity is what propelled the candidates. \n\nBen es wrong about Beto too. Beto failed no because the media didn\\u2019t back him, it\\u2019s because his liberal in Texas , is milqetoast at a national level. Ben claims he never had any actual backing except he actually got close to beating ted Cruz in Texas. That\\u2019s a sign he had actual backing. Pathetic commentary",

                    "body": "Good article and spot on.\n\nThough it's interesting that the focus of this was the downfall of journalism yet he mentions no history of journalism itself.\n\nYellow journalism was the defacto journalism found at the end of the 19th century and throughout the early 20th century. The goal wasn't to inform its readers, but to sell papers and or push narratives. If you're interested in this type of media empire visit Hearse Castle in California. Hearse was a media mongrel during that time, and straight up published lies because it sold well and helped push a particular narrative he wanted the public to believe.\n\nPeople got so sick of this type of journalism that by the time the Great Depression hit there was a massive back lash to the point that journalist had to clean up their acts. Thus we had the \"Muckraker\" journalists. These are the types that existed to actually find the stories, instead of creating the stories. We associate journalists with the muckrakers as they were the standard for 50-60 years. There was still bias among journalists, but they still believed in integrity to their profession. Media owners/runners worked hard to ensure the integrity was followed, though there was occasional manipulation of then narrative by the media.\n\nStarting around the 90's/2000's we saw muckrakers begin to die off. The 24 hour news channels and internet left the long fact finding methodologies of muckrakers to be boring, slow, and resulted in little results. Fox News showed that people were interested in opinion shows more so than the actual news. Fox also called out the other media (along with personalities like Rush Limbaugh) for being partisan and selectively covering stories. Instead of dedicating themselves to those standards, they completely abandoned them. Yellow journalism had returned. First it was who could break a story first, to whatever fake story could actually get them ratings for the day. Once yellow journalism became the standard journalism it didn't take long for leftist political operations to utilize them for narrative control.\n\nFake News applies pretty heavily to nearly every media source now. These entities do not care about reporting the news, or finding facts. They care about selling clicks/papers and pushing a narrative. The more sensational the story, the better. Trump being a very sensational figure created a match made in hell. Though it didn't matter if it was Trump, the media had gone full in on this type of model since roughly 2004. These entities **still pretend** to be news sources, thus Fake News. If they were honest about their new model I wouldn't have an issue with them. They pose as if they are unbiased and just trying to get to the truth while they lie their asses off and push narratives that support Democrats.\n\nIn my life the first time I was aware of this type of tactic was with Bowling for Columbine. Michael Moore was mostly an unknown film maker when that film dropped, and he spent the \"documentary\" acting as if he was *just trying* to get to the bottom of the tragedy. He faked an unbiased investigation, where he clearly was pushing a far left narrative. That video got a lot of neutral people to become anti-gun. We saw a similar thing some years later with \"Inconvenient Truth\" from Al Gore.\n\nI would say the most famous individual to pull this off and cement the new media paradigm was none other than Jon Stewart, host of the Daily show. Far left biased piece of shit individual, who spent his show pretending as if he was just \"mocking both sides\". Those who watched his show believed his propaganda. He even led a \"moderate march\" as if he was a moderate. Millions of millennial were fooled by the douche back, and actually went to him as a source for news even though he constantly just said \"I'm a comedian, you can't take me seriously\". His effect on our culture and interpretation of events was huge. He criticized democrats for being stupid or incompetent, and attacked Republicans for being evil, hypocrites, or down right destructive. Very rarely did he attack a left leaning media personality or source, and he usually handled them with kid's gloves.\n\n---\n\nThis board seems dead though. Sorry I haven't been around.

The fact that 60% of American women are obese yet still completely entitled when it comes to dating, which--in accordance with #2 on my list--makes dating far less desirable for men, especially when there's porn out there. David Bond, love him or hate him, did a full video on this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJVWc0SdzAE\n\n4. The breakdown of the family. Kids now must move out of their hometowns to have jobs, which causes a rift between them and their family and because they are working so hard just to survive, they don't want to have kids and fuck that up. Money is harder to come by and inflation has ruined everything else. \n\n5. The fact that women now have to work to support the family as well.",

I have no idea what you'r on about because you are vague and elide questions that attempt to clarify your position. You also have incorrectly said that my assertion doesn't logically follow from my premises. Of course it logically follows. My premises include: that moral degradation is the opposite of a benefit, that pleasure's value is context dependent, the context of this specific pleasure is rape. (I've also noted, from the beginning that even a utilitarian that the pleasure counts as a positive it is still outweighed by the negatives.)\n\nI don't know how I could have made it more simplified. Your premise that because somebody has degraded themselves as a human that they cannot qualify for any benefits is flawed. You can receive a benefit in the form of sexual pleasure whilst also degrade your value as a human being. This is literally word for word what I said. A rapist can value the pleasure they get more than they value their existence as a human.\n\n&gt; Do you disagree because you think pleasure is intrinsically good AND that it overrides the negatives of being a rapist?\n\nNo. I've already explained that a benefit doesn't have to override the negatives in order to qualify as a benefit. You're thinking of \"net benefit\". Have you not heard of a cost:benefit analysis?\n\n&gt; Tell you what, let's both do each other the courtesy of only claiming something is illogical if it violates one of the common formal fallacies that everyone knows, like creating a false syllogism, or presenting a false choice. Disagreeing with a premise, however, is not cause for an accusation of illogical.\n\nWell, you presented a false choice. I don't \"disagree\" that you can't simultaneously benefit from something whilst also degrading your value as a human. The two things are not mutually exclusive.\n\n&gt; Are you taking a utilitarian view of morality?\n&gt; or\n&gt; Are you describing the rapist's personal position?\n\nWe are talking about any benefits gained or experienced by the individual, so how could we be talking about anything other than their personal position? In any case, what does the moral value of pleasure even have to do with anything? The pleasurable act may be immoral, but to the rapist it doesn't matter; to them it's still a benefit.",

These students don't have enough time to study and do homework and wind up failing or just barely passing. Add to that, these students have been told it's in their best interest to take out a student loan so they can earn their degree in four years or less. However, the truth is a student taking out a student loan is in the school's best interest because of the massive cash flow student loans generate. \n\nI advise students to take out loans for their education only if they are in a STEM or similar program where there is high demand for graduates. Otherwise work full time and go to school part time while paying cash for the courses they do take. And yes, it will mean taking longer than four years to finish but at least they won't have crushing student loan debt.",

Even subs like r/okcupid, r/askwomen and r/badscience  have caved to  this by Saying that it is stupid bad people that are attracted to women don\\u2019t want to date transfer women. Their argument is that trans women are women, so it doesn\\u2019t make sense to not include them in the dating pool. Some dude on r/okcupid  said there is no reason that he wouldn\\u2019t date a transgender woman as a straight guy and that there is no reason she should tell him before hand, because their medical issues are none of his business while dating.  I have also seen people criticize guys not wanting to date transgender women with penises, because \\u201cyou are dating a person, not their genitals.\\u201c\n\n The fact that  this site regularly  takes such an asinine position as saying  there is no difference between a woman with a penis in a woman with a vagina shows me it is hardly worth spending my time on these days.",

Unfortunately I don\\u2019t see us going to war with anyone South of our border anytime soon as the CIA makes a lot of it\\u2019s black budget money from drug trafficking. And where there is chaos it is easier to traffic drugs and people under the radar. All that aside, if we did invade Mexico based on this it wouldn\\u2019t matter unless we planned on invading most of Central and South America, as there is always another cartel or mafia in the neighboring country who are a part of the drug trade. And to the people who think there is \\u201ctoo little government\\u201d, it\\u2019s the opposite. There is too much government and too few well armed and trained citizen militias.",

I've said for about 10 years now, we  (the USA) maybe should have invaded mexico a decade ago. Partly because of their complete refusal to mitigate the illegal immigration via our border with them (and their governments actual coaching and training on how to actually illegally cross the border) but also because of the cartels. They are responsible for huge amounts of drugs coming into our country and killing our citizens. They bribe the Mexican military and state police to run protection for them. The Mexican military has made incursions into the US many times and even shot at the US Border Patrol, even once shooting a Border Patrol chopper which had to make an emergency landing. \n\nTerrorism in the middle east is bad and threatens our national security but this is right on our southern border. It is an immediate and local threat to US national security. Mexico either cant or wont stomp these cartels out of existence but the might of the US Military sure as hell could.",
